## Projects

### PhotoArchive

This was my senior design project which was a collaboration between Los Angelesâ€™ Bureau of Engineering and CSULA. My group was asked to create a mobile application to save and upload images into their Azure database. Additionally, we also had to create a tagging system to keep those images organized and efficient to filter.

### C- Minus Project

Java based interpreter/parser mirroring the C- Minus Project for my Compilers class at CSULA. The program takes in a grammar and will output the terminals, non-terminals, first set, follow set and state set.
