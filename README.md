## Projects

### PhotoArchive

This project was a collaboration between Los Angelesâ€™ Bureau of Engineering and CSULA. We created a mobile application to save and upload images into their Azure database. Additionally, we created a tagging system to keep those images organized and efficient to filter.

### C- Minus Project

This is a Java based interpreter/parser mirroring the C- Minus Project. The program takes in a grammar and will output the terminals, non-terminals, first set, follow set and state set.
